*  Count of positives / sum of negatives

* notes : 
    * It is important to avoid using the `return` statement inside a loop (like a `for` loop) without ensuring that all necessary operations are completed. In the given case, the `return i;` statement was executed immediately during the first iteration of the loop, causing the function to stop and return the value of `i` without completing the loop or processing all the elements in the array. You should make sure that the calculations or logic inside the loop are finished before using `return` to return the final result.
